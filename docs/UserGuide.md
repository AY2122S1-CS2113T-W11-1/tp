## Features 

Kolinux provides a **single integrated platform** consisting of **5 core features**:

1. `module` - Module Manager
2. `timetable` - Timetable
3. `planner` - Event Planner
4. `bus` - Route Finder
5. `cap` - CAP Calculator

### Module Manager: `module`

The module manager allows users to `store`, `delete`, and `list` the modules they are taking for the semester. Users 
are also able to `view` important information regarding a module, such as the description and workload requirements. 
In addition, users are able to set a `grade` on the modules in their list for the purpose of CAP calculation using our 
in-built CAP calculator.

#### Add modules to module list by code: `module store`

Format: `module store MODULE_CODE `

- `MODULE_CODE` needs to be in uppercase letters

Example of usage:

- `module store CS2113T`

Demo:

```
Successfully stored module: CS2113T
....................................................................
```

#### Delete modules from module list by code: `module delete`

Format: `module delete MODULE_CODE `

- `MODULE_CODE` needs to be in uppercase letters

Example of usage:

- `module delete CS2113T`

Demo:

```
Successfully deleted module: CS2113T
....................................................................
```

#### List modules from module list: `module list`

Format: `module list `

Example of usage:

- `module list` when CS2113T is already stored in the list

Demo:

....................................................................
```

#### Set a module's grade in module list: `module grade`

Format: `module grade CODE/GRADE `

Example of usage:

- `module grade CS2113T/A` when CS2113T is already stored in the list

Demo:

```
....................................................................
CS2113T grade set to A
....................................................................
```

‚ùï Note: The grades set using this command will be used to calculate CAP based on your module list. 
You may choose to enter real grades to calculate your current CAP and/or enter target grades to calculate a CAP goal.

### Timetable: `timetable`

This feature allows users to `add` and `clear` lessons from their timetable based on the modules added in the module
manager. It also provides users an aesthetic visual representation of their timetable on CLI interface.

#### Add lessons to timetable : `timetable add`

Format: `timetable add DESCRIPTION/DAY/START_TIME/END_TIME`

* `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` needs to follow the following format: `hhMM`
* `DAY` must be from between Monday to Friday where `DAY` is not case-sensitive
  * i.e. `monday` is the same as `MONDAY`

Example of usage:

* `timetable add CS1010 TUT/Monday/1200/1400`
* `timetable add CS2113T LEC/friday/1600/1800`

Demo:
```
timetable add CS1010 TUT/Monday/1200/1400
Lesson has been added to timetable
....................................................................
```

#### Clear timetable: `timetable clear`

Demo:
```
timetable clear
Timetable has been cleared completely
....................................................................
```

### Event Planner: `planner`

The event planner works by allowing users to `add`, `delete`, and `list` any events happening on a specific date. 
This is for users to manage their schedules daily. This feature is also integrated with the timetable so that users 
will also be able to view their lessons on specific dates.

#### Add an event to Planner: `planner add`

Adds a new event to your schedule

Format: `planner add DESCRIPTION/DATE/START_TIME/END_TIME`

* The `DATE` needs to follow the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd`
* `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` needs to follow the following format: `hhMM`

Example of usage:

* `planner add MA1508E quiz/2021-10-10/1700/1800`

Demo:

```
planner add MA1508E quiz/2021-10-10/1700/1800
An event has been added to your schedule successfully!
....................................................................
planner add Watch movie/2021-10-10/1530/1730
You already have an event ongoing for that time period, do you still want to add? (y/n)
y
An event has been added to your schedule successfully!
....................................................................
```

‚ùï Note: Users who attempt to add an event that has a time conflict with another event will need to 
give additional confirmation if they wish to proceed.

#### List events: `planner list`

Lists events on a particular date

Format: `planner list DATE`

* The `DATE` needs to follow the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd`

Example of usage:

* `planner list 2021-10-10`

Demo:

```
planner list 2021-10-10
2021-10-10
15:30 - 17:30 Watch movie
17:00 - 18:00 MA1508E quiz
....................................................................
```

‚ùï Note: The `list` will include all the events and lessons occurring on the `DATE` specified.
_Visit the section on [`timetable`](#timetable-timetable) for commands to add lessons._

#### Delete an event from Planner: `planner delete`

Deletes an event from your schedule

Format: `planner delete DATE`

This command has two steps:
1. Input the command as shown in the format above.
2. The schedule of events on `DATE` will be displayed, find the ID of the event you wish to delete.
3. Input the ID to delete the event.

* The `DATE` needs to follow the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd`

Demo:
```
planner delete 2021-11-05
Please enter the ID of the event you wish to delete (Enter 'n' to terminate this operation):
07:00 - 07:30 10km run (id: 7)
10:00 - 12:00 Attend career talk (id: 9)
15:00 - 17:00 Watch movie (id: 1)
9
An event has been deleted from your schedule successfully!
....................................................................
planner list 2021-11-05
2021-11-05
07:00 - 07:30 10km run (id: 7)
15:00 - 17:00 Watch movie (id: 1)
....................................................................
```

‚ùï Note: Only events added via the `planner` will be displayed on the list in step 2.
Hence, users are not allowed to delete lessons added via the `timetable` from the `planner`.
_Visit the section on [`timetable`](#timetable-timetable) for commands to delete lessons._

### NUS Bus Route Finder: `bus`

The route finder helps users to find if there are bus routes between any two NUS bus stops. This feature allows users
to get familiarised with the NUS internal shuttle bus route.

Format: `bus /start_location /end_location`

* Bus stop names are not case sensitive

Example of usage:

* `bus /pgp /museum`

Demo:

```
Bus [D2] goes from PGP to MUSEUM
....................................................................
```

‚ùï Note: Only routes for buses A1, D1, D2 and E have been implemented so far.

### CAP Calculator: `cap`

The CAP calculator is an essential tool for many NUS students to keep track on their CAP and set desired grades for the
current semester. This feature is integrated with the module manager so that users can calculate their CAP based on the
grades set on the modules in the module manager.

Format: `cap MC_GRADE`

Example of usage:

* `cap 4A 6B+ 4B 4B- 4A+`

Demo:

```

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Locate the `/data` directory stored in the same folder as `Kolinux.jar`. Copy the directory to the other 
computer, in the same folder as `Kolinux.jar`. The data will be automatically read upon starting up `Kolinux`.

## Data Storage

Kolinux automatically creates a directory `/data` upon the first start up. The directory consists of the files:

`logger.log` - User activity log of the most recent session.

`planner.txt` - Planner data of the user.

`timetable.txt` - Timetable data of the user.

‚ùó Users are advised not to modify these files as it can corrupt important user data.
