# Welcome to Kolinux User Guide! 😃

## Introduction

_Kolinux_ helps NUS freshmen to better integrate into university life by allowing them to 
**manage their work** and **learn more about NUS**, all in a **single integrated platform**. It is optimized for CLI 
users so that they can access the information that they require faster by typing in commands easily.

_Kolinux_ offers a wide range of features for freshmen. These features include a **module manager**
for freshmen to manage their modules and view information about them, a **timetable** to view their classes, an 
**event planner** for freshmen to organise their schedule for the day, a **CAP calculator**, and a **route finder** 
for the NUS internal shuttle bus.

This user guide brings you on a tour around _Kolinux_ and gives you step-by-step instructions on using its features.
Alternatively, you may visit the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) for quick access to any of the features. You
may also navigate to the [List of Commands](#list-of-commands) to view a summary of all our available commands and
their usages.

## Features 

Kolinux provides a **single integrated platform** consisting of **5 core features**:

1. `module` - Module Manager
2. `timetable` - Timetable
3. `planner` - Event Planner
4. `bus` - Route Finder
5. `cap` - CAP Calculator

### Module Manager: `module`

The module manager allows users to [`store`](#add-modules-to-module-list-by-code-module-store), 
[`delete`](#delete-modules-from-module-list-by-code-module-delete), and 
[`list`](#list-modules-from-module-list-module-list) the modules they are taking for the semester. Users 
are also able to [`view`](#view-module-details-module-view) important information regarding a module, such as the 
description and workload requirements. In addition, users are able to set a 
[`grade`](#set-a-modules-grade-in-module-list-module-grade) on the modules in their list for the purpose of 
[`cap`](#calculate-overall-cap-from-modules-in-module-list-module-cap) calculation and grades suggestion.

#### Add modules to module list by code: `module store`

Format: `module store MODULE_CODE `

- `MODULE_CODE` is not case-sensitive, hence `cs2113t` and `CS2113T` will give the same output.

Example of usage:

- `module store CS2113T`

Demo:

```
Successfully stored module: CS2113T
....................................................................
```

#### Delete modules from module list by code: `module delete`

Format: `module delete MODULE_CODE `

- `MODULE_CODE` is not case-sensitive, hence `cs2113t` and `CS2113T` will give the same output.

Example of usage:

- `module delete CS2113T`

Demo:

```
Successfully deleted module: CS2113T
....................................................................
```

#### List modules from module list: `module list`

Format: `module list `

Example of usage:

- `module list` when CS2113T is already stored in the list

Demo:

```
CS2113T Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming

Workload:
Lecture: 2.0 hours
Tutorial: 1.0 hours
Project Work: 3.0 hours
Preparation: 4.0 hours
....................................................................
Remember to add the module's lessons to the timetable based on the workload
....................................................................
```

#### View module details: `module view`

Format: `module view MODULE_CODE`

* `MODULE_CODE` needs to be in uppercase letters

Example of usage:

* `module view CS1010`

Demo:

```
view CS1010
CS1010: Programming Methodology
Department: Computer Science
Faculty: Computing
Credits: 4
This module introduces the fundamental concepts of
problem solving by computing and programming using
an imperative programming language. It is the first
and foremost introductory course to computing.  Topics
covered include computational thinking and computational
problem solving, designing and specifying an algorithm,
basic problem formulation and problem solving approaches,
program development, coding, testing and debugging,
fundamental programming constructs (variables, types,
expressions, assignments, functions, control structures,
etc.), fundamental data structures (arrays, strings,
composite data types), basic sorting, and recursion.
....................................................................
```

#### Set a module's grade in module list: `module grade`

Format: `module grade CODE/GRADE `

Example of usage:

- `module grade CS2113T/A` when CS2113T is already stored in the list

Demo:

```
module grade CS2113T/A
CS2113T grade set to A
....................................................................
```

❕ Note: The grades set using this command will be used to calculate CAP based on your module list. 
You may choose to enter real grades to calculate your current CAP and/or enter target grades to calculate a CAP goal.

### Calculate overall CAP from modules in module list: `module cap`

Format: `module cap`

Example of usage:

- `module cap` when at least one module is already stored in the list with the module's grade

Demo:

```
module cap
Based on your available grade, your cap for this semester is 5.00
....................................................................
```

This feature also provides user with the minimum grade to get for the other modules in order to achieve desired CAP 
by including the CAP at the end of the command.

Format: `module cap DESIRED_CAP`

Example of usage:
- `module cap 4.0` when at least one module doesn't have the grade stored

Demo:

```
module cap 4.0
Based on your modules, you have to get an average grade of B+ or higher 
in order to achieve your desired CAP
....................................................................
```

### Timetable: `timetable`

This feature allows users to [`add`](#add-lessons-to-timetable--timetable-add) and 
[`delete`](#delete-lessons-from-timetable--timetable-delete) lessons from their timetable based on the modules 
added in the module manager. 
Users are also able to [`update`](#update-a-lesson-to-another-timing-your-timetable--timetable-update)
their existing lessons to another time slot.
It also provides users an aesthetic visual representation of their timetable for users to 
[`view`](#view-timetable-on-cli--timetable-view) on CLI.

#### Add lessons to timetable : `timetable add`

Format: `timetable add MODULE_CODE/LESSON_TYPE/DAY/START_TIME/END_TIME`

* Ensure `MODULE_CODE` is stored in the module list using 
[`module store`](#add-modules-to-module-list-by-code-module-store) first before adding to timetable
* `LESSON_TYPE` needs to be one of the following: 
  * `TUT` refers to tutorial
  * `LEC` refers to lecture
  * `LAB` refers to lab
* `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` needs to follow the following format: `hhMM` and must be between the school hours 
`0600` and `2100`
* `DAY` must be from between `Monday` and `Friday`
* `MODULE_CODE`,`LESSON_TYPE` and `DAY`  are not case-sensitive
  * i.e. `CS1010` is the same as `cs1010`
  * i.e. `TUT` is the same as `tut` or `Tut`
  * i.e. `monday` is the same as `MONDAY`


Example of usage:

* `timetable add CS1010/TUT/Monday/1200/1400`
* `timetable add CS2113T/LEC/friday/1600/1800`

Demo:
```
timetable add CS1010/TUT/Monday/1200/1400
Lesson has been added to timetable
....................................................................
```
❕ Note: Ensure `MODULE_CODE` is stored in the module list using
[`module store`](#add-modules-to-module-list-by-code-module-store) first before adding to timetable as only
the modules added to module list can be added to the timetable

#### Delete lessons from timetable : `timetable delete`

Format: `timetable delete MODULE_CODE/LESSON_TYPE/DAY`

* Ensure `MODULE_CODE` is stored in the module list using
  [`module store`](#add-modules-to-module-list-by-code-module-store) first before adding to timetable

### Event Planner: `planner`

The event planner works by allowing users to [`add`](#add-an-event-to-planner-planner-add), 
[`delete`](#delete-an-event-from-planner-planner-delete), and 
[`list`](#list-events-planner-list) any events happening on a specific date. 
This is for users to manage their schedules daily. This feature is also integrated with the timetable and the module 
manager so that users will also be able to view their lessons and exams on specific dates.

#### Add an event to Planner: `planner add`

Adds a new event to your schedule

Format: `planner add DESCRIPTION/DATE/START_TIME/END_TIME`

* The `DATE` needs to follow the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd`
* `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` needs to follow the following format: `hhMM`

Example of usage:

* `planner add MA1508E quiz/2021-10-10/1700/1800`

Demo:

```
planner add MA1508E quiz/2021-10-10/1700/1800
An event has been added to your schedule successfully!

❕ Note: Users who attempt to add an event that has a time conflict with another event/lesson/exam will need to 
give additional confirmation if they wish to proceed.

#### List events: `planner list`

Lists events on a particular date

Format: `planner list DATE`

* The `DATE` needs to follow the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd`

Example of usage:

* `planner list 2021-10-10`

_Exams will be automatically deleted as modules are deleted from the [`module`](#module-manager-module) manager._

### NUS Bus Route Finder: `bus`

The route finder helps users to find if there are [`bus`](#bus-route-search-bus) routes between any two NUS shuttle 
service bus stops. Users are recommended buses they can take to reach their destination. 
Users also have the ability to view the [`bus stop list`](#list-of-all-bus-stop-names-bus-stop-list) which contains 
all the bus stop names which are covered by the NUS shuttle bus service. 
This feature allows users to get familiarised with the NUS internal shuttle bus route.

#### Bus route search: `bus`

Format: `bus /start_location /end_location`

* Bus stop names are not case-sensitive

Example of usage:

* `bus /pgp /museum`

Demo:

```
Bus [D2] goes from PGP to MUSEUM
....................................................................
```

#### List of all bus stop names: `bus stop list`

Format: `bus stop list`

Example of usage:

* `bus stop list`

❕ Note: Routes implemented cover Buses A1, A2, D1, D2, E and K. Also routes are recommended if there is direct route or an indirect route
where the user needs to change and board another bus (only single change routes are recommended).

### CAP Calculator: `cap`

The CAP calculator helps users to keep track on their CAP and set desired grades for the
current semester. Users can choose between different formats of module 
([`cap mc`](#calculate-cap-using-modular-credit-cap-mc) or [`cap code`](#calculate-cap-using-module-code-cap-code)) 
and the respective grade to allow more command flexibility.

❕ Visit [`module cap`](#calculate-overall-cap-from-modules-in-module-list-module-cap) to see how this feature can
be used with the module manager.

#### Calculate CAP using modular credit: `cap mc`

Format: `cap mc MC/GRADE`

Example of usage:

* `cap mc 4/A 6/B+ 4/B 4/B- 4/A+`

Demo:

```
cap 4A 6B+ 4B 4B- 4A+
Your CAP for this semester will be 4.09 if you get your desired grades!
....................................................................
```

#### Calculate CAP using module code: `cap code`

Format: `cap code CODE/GRADE`

Example of usage:

* `cap code CS2113T/A CS2101/C CG2027/B-`

Demo:

```
cap code CS2113T/A CS2101/C CG2027/B-
Your CAP for this semester will be 3.40 if you get your desired grades!

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Locate the `/data` directory stored in the same folder as `Kolinux.jar`. Copy the directory to the other 
computer, in the same folder as `Kolinux.jar`. The data will be automatically read upon starting up `Kolinux`.

## Data Storage

Kolinux automatically creates a directory `/data` upon the first start up. The directory consists of the files:

`logger.log` - User activity log of the most recent session.

`moduleList.txt` - Module manager data of the user.

`planner.txt` - Planner data of the user.

`timetable.txt` - Timetable data of the user.

❗ Users are strongly advised not to modify these files as it can corrupt important user data and cause data loss.

## Contact Us

Our team welcomes users to contact us when faced with issues that this user guide fails to cover. We are
also open to any suggestions that users may have to improve _Kolinux_. 😃

User may find our contact information [here](AboutUs.md).
