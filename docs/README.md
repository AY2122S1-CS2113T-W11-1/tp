# Kolinux

Kolinux is designed and built to help NUS freshmen to better integrate into university life by allowing them to
**manage their work** and **learn more about NUS**, all in a **single integrated platform**. It is optimized for CLI
users so that they can access the information that they require faster by typing in commands easily.
